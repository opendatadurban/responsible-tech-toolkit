# (4) Procuring Responsible Tech

## **Advancing Responsible Technology through Government Procurement**

The [procurement of technology by governments](https://www.govtech.com/opinion/ethical-ai-procurement-requires-collaboration-accountability) is a critical process that directly impacts the efficacy and ethics of civic services and governance.

Governments often enter into long-term contracts with large technology vendors, as well as contracts with bespoke product developers. However, traditional procurement practices often fall short in promoting responsible technology. To address these shortcomings and align technology procurement with principles of responsibility, inclusivity, and transparency, a fundamental shift in approach is necessary.

Here are key legislative and technical recommendations to guide this transformation:

*   **Adopt an Overarching Digital Strategy**

    Governments should develop and adopt a comprehensive digital strategy that guides the investment (procurement and development) in technology. This strategy should prioritize the principles of responsible tech, ensuring that all technology initiatives align with broader societal values and goals. The strategy can serve as a framework for evaluating how well proposed technologies fit within the government's digital ecosystem and meet the needs of its citizens, and ensure digital autonomy of the state.
*   **Develop Ethical Procurement Guidelines**

    Create guidelines that prioritize vendors who demonstrate strong commitments to data privacy, security, and ethical tech practices. Consider including guidelines on “progressive contracting”, such as [network approaches to digital infrastructure.](https://datasmart.hks.harvard.edu/procuring-digital-infrastructure-how-system-approaches-can-produce-public-value)
*   **Use Procurement to Promote Equity**

    Include requirements for accessibility and non-discrimination in RFPs (Request for Proposals) to ensure technology solutions are inclusive.
*   **Incorporate Codes and Standards**

    Embedding specific codes and standards related to safety, privacy, accessibility, and ethics into procurement policies ensures that technology procured meets high levels of responsible tech criteria. These standards should be clear, measurable, and aligned with international best practices.
*   **Implement a Technology Review Process**

    Establish a technology review board or ethics committee that includes members with diverse expertise—such as ethics, data protection, accessibility, and sector-specific knowledge—to evaluate technology solutions before procurement. This process should assess the potential impacts of the technology on society, including privacy concerns, impacts on different segments of society, and value for money for tax payers.

    *   **Case study: NYC Automated Decision Systems Task Force**

        New York City established a [task force](https://www.nyc.gov/site/adstaskforce/index.page) to review automated (algorithmic) decision systems used by city agencies, focusing on fairness, accountability, and transparency. The task force sought public input to understand concerns about how these systems might affect residents, particularly in areas like policing, social services, and housing. This initiative highlighted the importance of public oversight in the use of AI and algorithms by the government, leading to [recommendations](https://www.nyc.gov/assets/adstaskforce/downloads/pdf/ADS-Report-11192019.pdf) for more transparent policies and practices.
*   **Ensure Contracts Protect Data Ownership and Value**

    Contracts with technology vendors must be carefully crafted to protect data ownership rights and ensure value for money. This includes considerations around use agreements, security, ongoing licensing, potential lock-in risks, and the ability to exit agreements without excessive penalties. Contracts should explicitly state data handling and storage practices, ensuring they comply with data protection laws, security standards and ethical standards.
*   **Promote Competitive and Inclusive Bidding**

    Revise tender processes to be more inclusive, allowing smaller companies and startups to compete alongside larger corporations. This could involve segmenting contracts, simplifying application processes, and providing clear guidelines on the evaluation criteria that prioritize responsible technology practices.
*   **Mandate Transparency and Accountability**

    Require technology vendors to adhere to high standards of transparency and accountability, particularly regarding data management and the algorithms used in their solutions. Governments can demand regular audits, impact assessments, and public reporting to ensure ongoing compliance with responsible tech principles.
*   **Community Engagement and Consent**

    Prioritize genuine community engagement and informed consent processes in the deployment of government technology tools. This involves clear communication about the benefits, risks, and privacy implications of technology solutions, ensuring that citizens have a voice in the decision-making process.

    *   **Case study**: **Oakland’s Privacy Advisory Commission**

        The city of Oakland, California, established a [Privacy Advisory Commission](https://www.oaklandca.gov/boards-commissions/privacy-advisory-board) to review city proposals involving surveillance technology. This commission, which includes community members, has the power to recommend privacy-protective policies and has led to the adoption of stricter guidelines for the use of surveillance tools by city agencies. This model demonstrates the effectiveness of involving community members directly in oversight roles.
*   **Continuous Monitoring and Evaluation**

    After procurement, implement continuous [monitoring and evaluation mechanisms](https://www.notion.so/MREL-2b99ff2b90224b94b3fee543efa03330?pvs=21) to assess the technology's impact over time. This should include feedback loops with users and stakeholders to identify any issues or areas for improvement, ensuring the technology continues to serve the public interest responsibly.
