# (2) Data Strategies and Policies

## <img src="../.gitbook/assets/icon-w-cert.png" alt="https://www.notion.so/icons/forward_lightgray.svg" data-size="line"> Integrating Responsible Tech in Data Strategies & Policies

Government Data Strategies and Policies, particularly at the municipal level, play a crucial role in shaping how technology and data are utilized to serve the public effectively and ethically. By embedding principles of responsibility into these strategies and policies, municipalities can ensure that technology serves as a tool for public good, enhancing services while safeguarding citizens' rights and data and the digital autonomy of the government on behalf of the citizens is protected.

Responsible Data Strategies should include, among others:

* Principles for data privacy and security
* Statements on open data
* Principles and guidelines for creation and use of artificial intelligence

### **Embedding Principles for Procurement**

* **Actionable Steps**
  * **Digital Strategy**: Develop an over-arching data and digital investment strategy that prioritises digital autonomy.
  * **Develop Ethical Procurement Guidelines:** Create guidelines that prioritize vendors who demonstrate strong commitments to data privacy, security, and ethical tech practices.
  * **Use Procurement to Promote Equity:** Include requirements for accessibility and non-discrimination in RFPs (Request for Proposals) to ensure technology solutions are inclusive.
* **Tools/Frameworks**
  * The [**Digital Services Playbook**](https://playbook.cio.gov/) by the U.S. Government provides strategies for effective digital services procurement, emphasizing user needs and value for money.
  * More Guidelines for procuring responsible tech are being developed here

### **Building Team Capacity and Culture**

* **Actionable Steps**
  * **Staff Job descriptions and responsibilities**: directly organise and recruit for the management of responsible tech
  * More Guidelines for procuring responsible tech are being developed here

### **Ensuring Data Security**

* **Actionable Steps**
  * **Adopt and Enforce Data Security Standards:** Implement standards such as ISO/IEC 27001 to manage and protect digital information.
  * **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular audits of municipal data systems to identify and mitigate potential vulnerabilities.
* **Tools/Frameworks (empty)**

### **Product Testing and Appeals**

* **Actionable Steps**
  * **Implement Rigorous Testing Protocols:** Before deployment, ensure all tech solutions undergo thorough testing, including accessibility and usability tests, to identify any issues.
  * **Establish an Appeals Process:** Create a transparent process for citizens to appeal or report concerns about technology use or decisions made by automated systems. (See here for case studies)
* **Tools/Frameworks**
  * **A/B Testing** and **User Testing Platforms** like UserTesting.com can facilitate comprehensive product testing.
  * **Algorithmic Impact Assessments (AIA)** can help evaluate the potential impacts of automated decision-making systems.

### **Case Studies for Inspiration**

*   **Amsterdam and Helsinki’s AI Registers**

    These cities have created [public-facing registers](https://ai-regulation.com/amsterdam-and-helsinki-launch-algorithm-and-ai-register/) that detail their use of AI systems, including the system’s purpose, data used, and the team responsible. This transparency initiative helps in oversight and public trust.
*   **Toronto’s Digital Infrastructure Strategic Framework**

    Toronto’s plan emphasizes equity, privacy, and transparency in the digital infrastructure, setting a precedent for responsible municipal data strategies.
