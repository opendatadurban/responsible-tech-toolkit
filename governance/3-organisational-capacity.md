Building a government technology and data team capable of ensuring responsible tech outcomes requires a thoughtful approach to hiring practices, emphasizing a blend of technical skills, ethical considerations, and a commitment to public service.

### **Good Practices for Hiring**

*   **Diverse and Inclusive Hiring Practices**

    Emphasize diversity in hiring to ensure a wide range of perspectives, backgrounds, and experiences. This diversity can lead to more innovative solutions and helps ensure that technology deployments consider the needs of all community members.

    Look for candidates with training or demonstrated interest in ethics, public interest technology, and responsible innovation. This can include formal education, certifications, or participation in relevant workshops and seminars.
*   **Interdisciplinary Skills**

    Seek candidates with interdisciplinary skills that span technology, social sciences, and humanities. This broad knowledge base helps in understanding the societal impacts of technology and designing solutions that are equitable and beneficial. Teams should include user design and community engagement specialists, people who understand the urban development and municipal systems and the technology sectors.
*   **Commitment to Continuous Learning**

    Given the rapid evolution of technology, look for individuals committed to continuous learning and staying abreast of the latest developments in technology ethics, data protection, and responsible innovation.
