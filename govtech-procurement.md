## What is GovTech and who defines it?

### Overview

The World Bank defines GovTech as the use of technology to support government operations, service delivery, and transparency. It's a mechanism for modernizing the public sector with citizens at the center (World Bank 2020).

In other words, OCL is designing some form of GovtTech, and products from Microsoft are also GovTech procured by the government through Microsoft.

### Guidelines

*   **How governments procure technologies**

    Governments often identify a need for technology to improve services or civic engagement. They might reach out to companies directly or issue public calls for vendors.
*   **Why must this process change?**

    Current practices are exclusionary for several reasons:

    * **Tenders Favor Big Companies:** Tender criteria often favor large corporations, excluding smaller organizations with potentially safer and more inclusive technology.
    * **Neglecting Ethical Considerations:** Focusing only on certain companies can lead to procuring harmful technologies without safeguards for citizens.
    * **Manufacturing Consent:** Governments sometimes force enrollment in GovTech tools, hindering transparency.
* **Tips/Recommendations (General)**
  *   **1. Incorporate Ethical and Social Impact Assessments**

      Governments should require comprehensive ethical and social impact assessments for all technology procurements. These assessments should evaluate the technology's impact on privacy, security, equity, and social cohesion.

      * Develop a standardized framework for assessments.
      * Involve stakeholders with diverse backgrounds.
  *   **2. Ensure Transparency and Public Engagement**

      Openly share information about the technologies, selection criteria, and intended uses. Establish public forums and feedback mechanisms for community input.

      * Establish channels for ongoing feedback and dialogue.
  *   **3. Adopt and Adhere to International and Industry Standards**

      **Why is This Important?**

      Using technologies that adhere to established standards ensures:

      * **Security and Privacy:** Built on best practices for protecting data.
      * **Compatibility:** Works with existing systems and ethical guidelines.

      * Conduct due diligence to verify vendor/internal team claims.
  *   **4. Prioritize user-centered design and customization**

      **Why is this important?**

      Technology should be user-friendly and meet the needs of its end-users. This includes customizing off-the-shelf solutions for local contexts and data sets.

  *   **5. Establish continuous monitoring and evaluation mechanisms**

      **What needs monitoring?**

      * Technology's impact, performance, and alignment with goals.
      * User and impacted communities' feedback.

      **Why is this important?**

      * Allows identification of unforeseen consequences and facilitates adjustments.
      * Supports transparency and accountability through regular reporting.
