### About the Responsible Tech Guidelines

This toolkit is anchored in the core ethos of Responsible Tech Principles, which serve as a compass for developing and deploying technology that positively impacts society. These principles emphasise the importance of engaging with stakeholders to ensure technology meets the needs of its users, safeguarding data security to protect personal and sensitive information, and upholding ethical standards in data analysis and artificial intelligence to minimise bias and advance fairness.

Responsible technology aligns technological advancements with societal values, promotes trust and transparency, and mitigates potential harms.
