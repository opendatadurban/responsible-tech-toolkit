## **Why This Toolkit Exists**

Technology is woven into the fabric of our lives, shaping everything from how we connect to how governments operate. But with great power comes great responsibility! That's why the Responsible Tech Toolkit was created.

This toolkit addresses the growing need for ethical and responsible practices in developing and using technology. It recognises that technology can have unintended consequences, raise ethical dilemmas, and potentially exacerbate existing inequalities.

The toolkit empowers individuals and teams to ask crucial questions throughout the tech development lifecycle. It provides a framework to assess potential risks, biases, and societal impacts. By using this toolkit, we can harness the power of technology for good, ensuring it benefits everyone and fosters a more just and sustainable future.

Be part of the rise of responsible tech!

* **Galleries**: Three _types_ of gallery styles:
  1. Cards with text preview.
  2. Cards with variety of image backgrounds and/or icon
  3. Cards with short synopses of the card content - **Important**: these card pages have to be locked for the synopses info to be ‘clickable’ - otherwise the summary content goes into edit mode when clicked. (New field in grid for this synopses.)
  4. All cards: Icons with circle background.
* **Locking pages**: Once development is done, the entire page can be ‘locked’ which would prevent editing and some of the unwanted behaviour, like the red outline on the navigation - if someone needs to edit, they can easily ‘unlock’ the page in the top right …-menu. Locking the page reduces the frustration of the text going into edit mode when one didn’t want to edit it.
* **Navigation**: (Temporary) Current side-navigation not great for mobile view
* Moved the duplicated pages out of the toolkit presentation, and placed them in the admin section
