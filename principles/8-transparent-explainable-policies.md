# (8) Transparent, explainable policies

## <img src="../.gitbook/assets/icon-w-cert.png" alt="https://www.notion.so/icons/forward_lightgray.svg" data-size="line"> **Be clear, be open**

Communicate how your technology works, explain decision-making algorithms, and avoid opaque systems.

* **Communicate Technology Function:** Provide clear and accessible explanations of how the technology works and its intended purpose.
* **Explain Decision-Making Algorithms:** Offer transparency into decision-making algorithms, avoiding black-box models, where possible.
* **Document Development Process:** Maintain clear documentation of the development process for future reference and accountability.
* **Promote Ongoing Dialogue:** Encourage ongoing communication and feedback from users and stakeholders throughout the technology's lifecycle.
