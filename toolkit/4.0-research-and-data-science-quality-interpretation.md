## **Data Quality and Interpretation**

### **Ensuring Quality and Integrity**

**Data quality / Quality Data Science & Interpretation / Visualization:** Often data quality and addressing interpretation issues relies on good data science towards informed decision making. Consider data as a resource that shapes pathways towards creating equitable experiences. **It is not neutral,** but reflective of socio-cultural, and economic histories, contexts and experience!

To ensure the quality and integrity of the research and data science stages, it's essential to:

1. Foster a culture of openness and critical thinking among the team, encouraging scrutiny and peer review.
2. Maintain meticulous documentation of the data collection, analysis, and interpretation processes, facilitating reproducibility and transparency.
3. Engage with stakeholders throughout the project to ensure the research remains aligned with its objectives and the needs of the intended audience.

*   **Key actions**

    > **Audit Your algorithms** for oppression before rolling them out, but also engage in frequent auditing, making your source code available for external support and insights

*   **Key actions**

    > **Co-liberation** means that you understand how your flourishing and/ liberation is tied to marginalized communities. When you work with marginalized groups, you build trusting relationships that also create space for them to learn important skills that empower them, but also allow them to impart their knowledge and experiences in your process. Note: **Communities affected by a problem find the most creative approaches to addressing them.**

    > Co-liberation is non-extractive. So communities benefit more from the design and product they helped build! Or their lives and knowledge helped build!

    **Tip**: Users or beneficiaries of a tool often shape the eventual updates of the said tool. It is important to understand the cultures around a specific technology to know how it will impact the said group in the first place.

Missing data sets, over representation in data sets, under representation, can all cause design and algorithmic injustices.

*   **Key actions**

    > Build the data from scratch using existing literature and community collaboration.

    > Transforming the data collected, i.e. qualitative, quantitative , visual media to computing languages.
    >
    > > Explore techniques to address over and under representation. This is easily addressed through diverse data representation in your model, and balancing out the sample size.

    **Tip**: While having diverse data helps mitigate biases and track possible injustice, it still risks contributing to a _deficit narrative._ That is, reducing minoritized groups to their problems, on collecting data that mirrors those problems.
