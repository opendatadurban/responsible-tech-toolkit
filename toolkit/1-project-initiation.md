# (1) Project Initiation

## **Responsible Tech Approach for Project Initiation**

### **Set-up Meeting with Partner**

_The process begins with a meeting to explore the project brief and understand the partner's requirements._

*   **Decision to Develop**

    Based on the initial connect, a decision is made whether to proceed with the project development.
*   **UX and Development Briefing**

    A detailed briefing is prepared, focusing on user experience (UX) and development requirements.
*   **OCL Committee Review**

    The project brief is presented to the OCL Committee to ensure alignment with OCL values and strategy.
*   **Project Approval**

    Upon approval, the project moves forward with scoping, and a Project Lead and Project Custodian are appointed.

And remember, “[If you can avoid building it, don’t build it](https://mitgovlab.org/resources/dont-build-it-a-guide-for-practitioners-in-civic-tech/)”

&#x20;\*\*Defining\*\*: Context and Clear Problem Framing

* **Key Actions**
  * **Conduct** a comprehensive needs assessment to understand the community's challenges and opportunities. This could involve primary or secondary qualitative and quantitative research methods, such as surveys, interviews, and data analysis.
  * **Develop** a problem statement that clearly articulates the issue being addressed, avoiding assumptions about technology solutions from the outset.
*   **Responsibility**

    Project Lead, in collaboration with a multidisciplinary team including social scientists, data analysts, and community liaison officers.
*   **Tips**

    Remain open to findings that challenge initial assumptions about the problem or its solutions.

&#x20;\*\*Engagement\*\*: Community and Stakeholders

* **Key Actions**
  * **Stakeholder** mapping to identify and categorize stakeholders by their interest and influence on the project. Where appropriate, use digital platforms and social media to reach a broader audience and facilitate ongoing dialogue.

&#x20;\*\*Teaming\*\*: Establishing the Right Balance of Skills

* **Key Actions**
  * **Define** the skill sets and roles required for the project, emphasizing a balance of technical, ethical, design, and community engagement expertise.
  * **Recruit** team members who not only possess the necessary technical skills but also demonstrate a commitment to responsible technology and public interest values.
*   **Responsibility**

* **Tips**
  * Regularly review and update governance policies to reflect new insights, challenges, or changes in the project scope.
  * Clarify the role of the funders, City stakeholders, OCL and other stakeholders to identify and resolve ethical risks, harmful tech or waste
