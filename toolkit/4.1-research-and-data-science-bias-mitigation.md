## Algorithmic Justice and Bias Mitigation

### Addressing injustices and bias in your model

Addressing data bias should eventually move us towards addressing algorithmic oppression. If you understand that algorithms exist in a social world with historical context, then you will understand that technology impacts are shaped by the society that uses it. Which in this case is deeply rooted in inequality\*\*.\*\*

*   Key actions

    > Interpret the data within the context of the research problem, considering external factors that could influence the results.

    > Collaborate with domain experts to ensure the findings are meaningful and accurately reflect the complexities of the subject matter.

    > Lay out the various frictions that occur in a given problem and contextual analysis. Frictions of power include how you frame your research problem at the beginning. For instance, how might we transform the transportation system to work for care givers (who are often women), and people who live in racially, and class segregated communities?

*   Key actions

    > Assess the analysis for potential biases that could affect the interpretation of the data. This includes confirmation bias, selection bias, and algorithmic bias.

    > Deliberate with diverse team members: collect diverse team members views on the interpretation of the data in order to mitigate any disciplinary or other blind spots. If possible validate through engagement with samples of the data sources.

    > Evaluate the equity of the analysis, especially when the findings have implications for different groups within the population. Pose questions regarding the distributional impacts of the implications - i.e. how the interpretation affects different groupings.

    > Make room for reflexivity, and create a pipeline where the community you are working with learns and rechannel resources available to you to empower them in non-extractive ways.

    **Tip**: Diverse team mean having team members who are not part of a marjoritized group (i.e white male), ones who are part of the community you are designing with, and provide them with the autonomy and power to inform decision

**How to Test Dystopian Models and Biases**

* Key actions
  1. **Identify your hypothesis.** For example, Cars are designed to be more harmful to non-masculine and / or male drivers because crash test dummies are often designed to be mid-sized male.
  2. **Collect missing datasets**: Collecting or sourcing dummies that are much diverse in size, and of different populations for your test.
  3. Then create your own regression model that reverse engineers the algorithms to test for racial, gender, sexuality, ethnicity, locational and class biases among others
  4. Write your risk assessment and analysis.

*   Key actions

    > Identifying bias and risk doesnâ€™t complete the cycle of addressing the problem. **Communicate** the findings in a clear, transparent, and accessible manner. Use visualizations to help convey complex data insights effectively.

    > **Include limitations** of the data and potential sources of error in the analysis to provide a complete picture of the findings.

*   Key actions

    1. Use data science to challenge Data science
    2. Finding ways to partner with the city to show the depth of the issue which may prompt policy on accountability, and improvements. For instance, a policy that moves to redesign transportation systems that takes into account care giver patterns, disabled people, class and age dynamics, gender, and sustainability.
    3. Move from community problem to gathering proof to policy change, through collective advocacy.

    **Tip**: Collecting, analyzing and reporting harm is a method of speaking to power however should be accompanied by community engagement, political organizing and protest.
