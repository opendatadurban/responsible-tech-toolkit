# (7) The MREL Framework

## <img src="../.gitbook/assets/icon-w-inclusive.png" alt="https://www.notion.so/icons/forward_lightgray.svg" data-size="line"> Monitoring, Reporting, Evaluating, Learning (MREL)

The MREL framework is crucial for fostering responsible technology development and deployment, ensuring that the technology solutions are ethical, protect data privacy, and utilize public funds efficiently.

Here’s how to integrate these considerations into the MREL process:

### Monitoring

* **Action Steps**
  * **Identify Ethical KPIs:** Develop KPIs focused on inclusivity, data privacy, value for money and ethical use of technology.
  * **Implement Privacy-Focused Monitoring Tools:** Use tools that respect user privacy while collecting essential data for performance monitoring.
  * **Conduct GESI Scorecards:** Regularly review product features to identify potential to advance gender and social inclusion considerations, or identify risks of exclusion of specific groups.
*   **Responsible Roles**

    Project Manager

    Data Protection Officer
* **Tips**
  * Incorporate [privacy by design](https://www.notion.so/Design-and-Development-6ee7f7a2eb7c4adfa5a128dca84b8154?pvs=21) principles in selecting monitoring tools.
  * Regularly update KPIs to reflect evolving ethical standards and regulations.

### Reporting

* **Action Steps**
  * **Incorporate Ethics in Reporting:** Highlight efforts and measures taken to ensure inclusivity, data privacy, and ethical considerations in regular reports.
  * **Consider Transparent Reporting:** Open reports to the public for transparency on key decisions, spend, and progress.
  * **Document Ethical Considerations:** Keep detailed records of decisions made to address ethical concerns, including stakeholder feedback.
  * **Transparency Reports:** Publish transparency reports detailing data usage, privacy measures, and inclusivity efforts.
* **Responsible roles**
  * Data Protection Officer
  * Community Engagement Specialist
* **Tips**
  * Use clear, non-technical language to enhance understanding among all stakeholders.
  * Engage with external ethics reviewers for report validation.

### Evaluation

* **Action Steps**
  * **Ethical Impact Assessment:** Evaluate the social and ethical impact of the product, focusing on potential harms or exclusions. _This step_ can be complicated by the multiple legislative mandates of government, which can at times come into conflict with one another - such as the mandate to protect property, and the mandate to protect data rights, and the mandate to provide services and shelter when dealing with informal settlements data for use in either improved planning and service delivery, or evictions. A rights-based approach focusing on the data producer is helpful: ensure that their right to consent to how their data is used has been protected. Secondly, ensure that the legislative hierarchy of rights is being honoured when assessing potential costs and benefits or benefits and harms of a technology solution (for example, Constitutional rights are superior to by-laws).
  * **Data Privacy Compliance Check:** Regularly review compliance with data protection laws and ethical guidelines.
  * **Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBAs):** Evaluate the efficient use of public funds in relation to the ethical and social benefits of the technology. ⚠️ However, this assessment should not be done in isolation of other assessments or deliberations, as CBAs have limited ability to capture all costs and benefits, and in particular have limited ability to capture the distributional impacts of costs and benefits and may therefor skew decisions towards specific groups.
*   **Responsible roles**

    Ethics Committee

    Chief Data Officer
* **Tips**
  * Include diverse perspectives in the evaluation process to uncover potential biases and harms.
  * Utilize ethical frameworks and impact assessment tools designed for technology evaluation.

### Learning

* **Action Steps**
  * **Integrate Feedback Mechanisms:** Establish clear channels for users and affected groups to provide feedback on ethical concerns and inclusivity.
  * **Conduct Ethical Review Sessions:** Regularly review project outcomes and processes to identify ethical learnings and improvements.
  * **Update Ethical Guidelines:** Revise internal guidelines and documentation based on learnings to improve future projects.
*   **Responsible roles**

    Entire Team

    With leadership from the Chief Technology Officer
* **Tips**
  * Foster a culture where ethical considerations are discussed openly and integrated into daily work.
  * Document and share learnings widely to promote ethical practices across the industry.

### Tools and Frameworks

* **Ethical Monitoring Tools:** Tools such as _Fairness Flow_ to monitor algorithmic bias.
* **Privacy Analysis Software:** Tools like _Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PETs)_ for data protection.
* **Inclusivity Guidelines:** Utilize frameworks like the _Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)_ for accessibility audits.
* **Ethical Impact Assessment Frameworks:** Tools like the _Algorithmic Impact Assessment (AIA)_ for evaluating social and ethical impacts.
* **Advisory Boards and Review Panel**s: Establishing panels of _cross-sector advisors_ can strengthen the oversight and monitoring process.
* **Algorithmic registers**: Publishing registers of data tools, such as algorithmic registers, can enhance transparency and oversight.
