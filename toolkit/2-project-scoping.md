# (2) Project Scoping

### <img src="../.gitbook/assets/icon-w-scope.png" alt="https://www.notion.so/icons/forward_lightgray.svg" data-size="line"> Identifying project goals, deliverables, and success metrics.

Framework for Defining Context and Clear Problem Framing through Dystopian Future Use Cases:

* **(1) Scenario Development**
  * **Action**: Gather a multidisciplinary team to brainstorm potential dystopian outcomes related to the project. Consider scenarios like exacerbating social inequalities, enabling surveillance and privacy breaches, and causing environmental harm.
  * **Tools**: Use scenario planning tools and templates to structure the brainstorming process. Responsibility: Facilitated by the Project Lead, with inputs from the entire project team, including ethics advisors and community engagement specialists.
* **(2) Reverse Engineering**
  * **Action**: For each dystopian scenario, work backward to identify what decisions or project aspects could lead to such outcomes. This includes technology misuse, data mismanagement, and lack of oversight.
  * **Tools**: Utilize reverse timeline tools or back-casting techniques to map the steps leading to each dystopian outcome. Responsibility: Ethics advisors and risk management teams, with support from technical leads.
* **(3) Design Against Dystopia**
  * **Action**: Develop strategies and safeguards to prevent the identified dystopian outcomes. This might involve design choices, governance frameworks, and community engagement strategies.
  * **Tools**: Employ design thinking methodologies to ideate and prototype solutions that mitigate identified risks.
  * **Responsibility**: Design and development teams, in collaboration with ethics and governance advisors.
* **(4) Documentation and Communication**
  * **Action**: Clearly document the dystopian scenarios, the reverse-engineered pathways, and the preventative strategies. Communicate these findings with all stakeholders to ensure transparency and accountability.
  * **Tools**: Use collaborative documentation platforms to share and discuss the findings.
  * **Responsibility**: Project Custodian, with the support of the communication team.

#### Stakeholder Mapping and Engagement Plan

**Stakeholder map**: Develop a detailed stakeholder mapping to identify all parties affected by or interested in the project. This should include marginalized or vulnerable groups whose voices might otherwise be overlooked.

* **Responsibility**: Community Engagement Specialist, with support from the Project Lead.
* **Tools**: Stakeholder mapping tools and engagement planning templates.
* **Steps**: Categorize stakeholders by their level of influence and interest, plan targeted engagement activities for each group, and establish mechanisms for ongoing dialogue and feedback throughout the project lifecycle.

#### Ethical Impact Assessment (EIA)

Conduct an Ethical Impact Assessment to systematically evaluate the ethical implications of the project. This should cover aspects like data privacy, equity, and potential harm to individuals or communities.

* **Responsibility**: Conducted by ethics advisors, with input from the entire project team. Tools: Utilize EIA frameworks and checklists to guide the assessment.
* **Steps**: Identify ethical risks, evaluate their likelihood and impact, and propose mitigation strategies. Engage with stakeholders to validate and refine the assessment. At this stage it may be useful to take the team through a tool such as [https://responsibletech.se/tool.php#firstbatch](https://responsibletech.se/tool.php#firstbatch)
