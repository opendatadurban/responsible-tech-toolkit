# (3.1) Design and Development (Safety)

### <img src="../.gitbook/assets/icon-w-inclusive.png" alt="https://www.notion.so/icons/forward_lightgray.svg" data-size="line"> Safety by Design

Prioritise user safety and anticipate system manipulation. This avoids online harms in any form. this could be technology facilitated, which means that harm caused through the use or as a result of the use of technologies. It is proactive in protecting users. Safety by Design Works hand in hand with privacy by design. One cannot exist without the other.

And **remember**, “what we need to explain and account for are not only the inner workings of \[our technology products], but also the history, culture, and context that lead to discriminatory outputs in the first place” (D’Ignazio and Klien, 2020)

*   **Key actions**

    > Detail the various risk levels and threat models for different user and beneficiary types of your product. In an intersectional framework, you may categories users and beneficiaries using: Age, gender, family configuration, geographic location, sexuality, race, disability, ethnicity, educational background, language, economic status, and sustainability

    > _**Risk**_ is not evenly distributed ,but you have to design with the person with the highest risk.

*   **Key actions**

    > **Safeguards** could be reporting mechanisms that are easily findable, accessible and usable. The process for reporting and support for people who are exposed to risk should be clear.u no longer need, after a specific period of time or when requested to do so by the user.

    > Block certain uses that can harm users and beneficiaries. For instance, certain features of a product turned off for children to avoid interactions with adults and possible avenues for child abuse. Or testing against evasive uses, and blocking those uses.

    > Frequently update your product to address potential vulnerabilities that arise over the lifetime of the product. Our products will never be perfect from the start, which is why testing, auditing and user feedback value-chains are important to understanding the emerging vulnerabilities and blocking those with updated versions.

### <img src="https://www.notion.so/icons/checkmark-line_green.svg" alt="https://www.notion.so/icons/checkmark-line_green.svg" data-size="line"> Accountability and Transparency

*   **Key actions**

    > **Transparency** enables easy auditing of your algorithms and models for possible vulnerabilities . This goes without saying, it does help to make your source code open. Open Data right?

    > Ensure that your policies are clear and easily understandable. This also means how to hold you accountable if you don’t meet some of the basic safe guarding that is required. In the spirit of co-creation, building those policies with communities of users, and of practice, and addressing possible frictions and power dynamics are particularly important!

    > Transparency and accountability also mean that as you co-create with communities, you impart your knowledge on each other. The community is able to benefit from improved data, and technology skills that enable them understand your product and eventually shape the future iterations. _**And, for people to hold you accountable, they need to understand what they are holding you to account for!**_
*   **Tip**

    Algorithmic Auditing generally helps with ensuring accountability, but it has to be merged with reporting mechanisms , policies to enforce safety standards and escalation points that are followed through. Accountability also means ensuring the benefits of your designs act as benefit for the community.

### Reflection

1. What factors are crucial to your product?
2. What other intersectional details exist for your context?
