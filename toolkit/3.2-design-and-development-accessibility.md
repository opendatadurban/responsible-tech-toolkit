# (3.2) Design and Development (Accessibility)

## <img src="../.gitbook/assets/icon-w-inclusive.png" alt="https://www.notion.so/icons/forward_lightgray.svg" data-size="line"> Accessibility by Design

**Accessibility by Design** means that people are not restricted from using a specific product or service due to their disability or social positionality. **Disability**, meaning, unable to for various biological, and social reasons. Approaches to ‘_who is disabled or not_’ is often measured along lines of power. That is who is considered as a default human, versus who has to constantly reiterate their humanity.

* **Tip**: This includes technical and user interaction, visual design requirement, social parameters of accessibility. It is not just feature that is an after thought, but embedded in the design of services and products to make it accessible to permanent, temporary, and situationally disabled people.
* **Remember:** many disabled people do not ask for their disability to be “taken away”, but for our products, tools, social spaces and infrastructure to be made with and for them. And just like any other design practices we are accounting for history, culture, and context that lead to discriminatory outputs in the first place

*   **Key actions**

    > Work with users or beneficiaries of the product or service who are disabled to reveal additional opportunities that will increase accessibility, pushing towards the positive impact of the product.

    > **Example**: Some disabled people may find that when cities have a delivery option their monthly medical supplies, it allows them access their needed medication without having to bear the cost and risks of mobility.

*   **Key actions**

    > A lot of assistive devices tend to be very expensive, and a poor disabled person may be hindered from accessing some of these products because accessibility functions were never considered in design. Design here could include physical, virtual, service or communal spaces.

    > Lets take a citizen portal that requires the user to prove that they are human for example. Have you created or enabled an audio option for CAPTCHA? Have you considered other approaches to “prove” a person is human?

*   **Key actions**

    > What sensory considerations have you put in place for people who are :

    * hypersensitive to light and sound or cannot hear at all.
    * Colour blind.
    * People who are partially sighted or totally blind.
    * Who cannot read in certain fonts.

*   **Key actions**

    > This often relate to how you present content in an easily perceivable and understandable manner.

    > Can the reader skim through your content? Is it easily understandable by people at various knowledge levels? That is less technical? Make it short. No one wants to read blocks of texts, unless it is a novel.

&#x20;\*\*Reflection Question\*\*

When you think of designing for disability, what’s the first thing that comes to mind? Maybe it’s a reserved parking spot, a ramp up to an entryway. Designing digital products and services need to account for this diversity of usage as well.
